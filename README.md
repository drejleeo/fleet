# üåä Fleet

## üíª Homelab using FOSS & Self-hosting

This project represents a fleet of ships (services) each responsible for its own cargo (containers).
Think of it as a homelab, but we use the words proposed by the chosen technology, so it becomes a journey.
Plus we navigate ‚éà

 - [ ] Implement feature toggle to allow only the desired stacks.
 - [ ] Create a system for easy secrets management, while using best practices.
